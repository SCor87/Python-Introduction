#Lines 10 - 12 have the same idea behind them regarding variables as in 
#'1. Variables' and '2. Scores' except that the mathematical calculation is different.
#Line 8 uses the 'print' function for output, which includes the variable in line 7.
#However, within the parentheses, it adds a string prior to the variable name.
#This can be achieved by opening double quotations ("") inside of the function
#parentheses, where within the double quotations, a string can be entered relevant
#to what will be output. Then, after the closing quotation, the string and variable
#should be separated by a comma (,) as seen in line 13.

quantity = 9
price = 3
bill = quantity * price
