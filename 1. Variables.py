#Variables are assigned by using the assignment operator '='
#This stores the value on the right hand side into the variable name on the left hand side.
#eg line 10 - 'A' is the variable, '20' is the value.
#Variables are case sensitive. If we later tried to call 'a' in the same example, we would get an error.
#Variables can be reassigned. Instead of 'A=20', you can reassign to 'A=4'
#Line 12 is assigning the value of 'A' and 'B' to a new variable called 'C' by carrying
#out a simple mathematical calculation. The mathematical expression '+' is used for this calculation.
#Variables are output by calling on the 'print' function, as seen in line 13.
#It's important to note that variables must be given meaningful names for future reference.

A=20
B=89
C=A+B
print(C)
