#A partial rewrite of '1. Variables', where variables have been given more meaningful names.
#Meaningful variable names are important so yourself or future developers can understand
#the purpose of the variable.
#Again, the 'total' variable is carrying out a simple calculation on stored values from 
#the variables on lines 8 - 10.
#'print' function in use on line 12 to output value of 'total' variable.

physics = 75
maths = 95
chemistry = 60
total = physics + maths + chemistry
print(total)
